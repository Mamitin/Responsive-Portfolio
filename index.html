            <p>I am adventurous, diligent, and welcome challenges. I have spearheaded all facets of administration, including budgets, serving
             as the Executive Assistant to the Vice President of IT while training in technology. After establishing my credentials as a Level 1 Desktop Technician, I 
             continued to perform duties in both areas before being promoted to a Level 2.</p>
      
            <p>As a single mother of a beautiful ten year old, son, I am committed to building my skillset, advancing my career, and continuing 
             to propel myself forward. By meeting my financial obligations and setting an example for my son, I am relentless to reach higher ground.</p>
      
            <p>I am currently enrolled in a Coding Program through UC Berkeley to thrust myself towards my ultimate goal.</p>
